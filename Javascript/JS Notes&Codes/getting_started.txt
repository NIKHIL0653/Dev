What can we expect?
1. prohramming primer
2. Three pillars of JS (types/coersion, scope/closures, this/prototypes)

1. Programming Primer:
-> values: 42, 3.14 (both are just numbers unlike integer and float) 
           "Hello, Friend (string)
           true, false (boolean)
           null, undefined (primitive/empty values)
           [1,2,3], {name: "Nikhil"} : non-primitive values


-> operations: number operations => 3+4, 43 - 1
               string concatenation => "Nikhil" + "Choudhary"
               boolean operations => true && false, true || false
               unary operator => !false
               binary operator (comparision) : 3.0 == 3/ 3.0 === 3, 3 < 4
               logical operator => true || false


-> variables: var name = "Nikhil Choudhary"
              var age = 23
              var friends = ["Brian", "Kyle"];
              --> some other operations with variables:
              var age = 23;
              age++;
              age += 2;
              age; // 25



expressions & statements: var age = 23; (statement)
                          age = 1 + (age * 2); (expression)


 decisions, loops, functions
